    The <strong>body fat percentage (BFP)</strong> of a human or other living
    being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass; body fat includes
    essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to
    maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body
    fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing
    and other hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 2–5% in men,
    and 10–13% in women (referenced through NASM). Storage body fat consists of
    fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in
    the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended total body fat percentage
    exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above. A number of methods
    are available for determining body fat percentage, such as measurement with
    calipers or through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis.

    The body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only
    body measurement which directly calculates a person's relative body
    composition without regard to height or weight. The widely used body mass
    index (BMI) provides a measure that allows the comparison of the adiposity
    of individuals of different heights and weights. While BMI largely increases
    as adiposity increases, due to differences in body composition, other
    indicators of body fat give more accurate results; for example, individuals
    with greater muscle mass or larger bones will have higher BMIs. As such, BMI
    is a useful indicator of overall fitness for a large group of people, but a
    poor tool for determining the health of an individual.
