    The <strong>body mass index (BMI)</strong> or Quetelet index is a value
    derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is
    defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is
    universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms
    and height in metres.

    The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat,
    and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight,
    normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value. However, there is
    some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories
    should be placed. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5
    kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People
    of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body
    fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of
    type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the WHO cut-off
    point for overweight, 25 kg/m2, although the cutoff for observed risk varies
    among different Asian populations.
